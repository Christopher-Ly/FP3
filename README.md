### A Team Name
* Blue Turtle Shell (Unofficial)

### Project Title
* Lone Wolf (Unofficial).

### Project Basic Concept
* We are planning to have our project be a maze like game.
* The game will start out with a blank playing field ,(Initially the size of the field will be large), with your playable character and a few enemyies.
* The objective will be to manuvure through the playing field and avoid collisions with any enemies on the field. 
* We would like to be able to keep track of the total time you're playing a round of the game, in order to display your record. 
* Also, as the game progresses and you reach certain times then we would like to add more enemies to the playing field, increase their speed, and create a maze on the field.
* We are still deciding whether after a certain checkpoint (time) a destination will appear where you will complete the level and continue to the next one where the playing field will be smaller in size for increased difficulty. 
* Inspiration from asteroids and pacman.
* All of this is subject to change and as we continue to work more may be added or removed.
